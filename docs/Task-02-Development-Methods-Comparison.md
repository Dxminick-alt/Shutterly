# Task #2: Software Development Methods - Comparison

## 1. Waterfall Methodology

### Description
Sequential software development approach where progress flows downward through phases like a waterfall.

### Advantages
✅ Clear structure and milestones  
✅ Easy to understand and manage  
✅ Well-documented at each phase  
✅ Works well for small projects with clear requirements  
✅ Easy to measure progress  

### Disadvantages
❌ Inflexible to changes  
❌ Late testing phase  
❌ No working software until late in cycle  
❌ High risk and uncertainty  
❌ Not suitable for complex projects  

### Best Use Cases
- Small projects with well-defined requirements
- Projects with stable technology
- Short-duration projects

## 2. Agile Methodology

### Description
Iterative approach emphasizing flexibility, customer collaboration, and rapid delivery of working software.

### Advantages
✅ Flexible and adaptive to changes  
✅ Continuous customer feedback  
✅ Working software delivered frequently  
✅ Better collaboration  
✅ Early detection of issues  
✅ Higher customer satisfaction  

### Disadvantages
❌ Less predictable timelines  
❌ Requires experienced team  
❌ Lack of documentation  
❌ Difficult to measure progress  
❌ Scope creep risk  

### Best Use Cases
- Projects with evolving requirements
- Customer-centric applications
- Modern web/mobile applications

## 3. Scrum (Agile Framework)

### Description
Framework using fixed-length iterations (sprints) with defined roles and ceremonies.

### Advantages
✅ Clear roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Team)  
✅ Regular feedback cycles (sprints)  
✅ Transparent progress tracking  
✅ Self-organizing teams  
✅ Continuous improvement  

### Disadvantages
❌ Requires cultural change  
❌ Can be challenging to scale  
❌ Requires commitment from all stakeholders  
❌ Daily meetings can be time-consuming  

### Best Use Cases
- Complex product development
- Teams of 5-9 members
- Projects requiring rapid iterations

## 4. DevOps

### Description
Culture and practice emphasizing collaboration between development and operations teams with automation.

### Advantages
✅ Faster deployment cycles  
✅ Improved collaboration  
✅ Automated testing and deployment  
✅ Better quality and reliability  
✅ Continuous integration/delivery  

### Disadvantages
❌ Requires significant cultural shift  
❌ Initial setup cost and complexity  
❌ Requires automation expertise  
❌ Security concerns if not properly implemented  

### Best Use Cases
- Cloud-based applications
- Microservices architecture
- Continuous delivery requirements

## 5. Spiral Model

### Description
Risk-driven process model combining iterative development with systematic aspects of waterfall.

### Advantages
✅ Risk management focus  
✅ Good for large projects  
✅ Flexibility to accommodate changes  
✅ Early prototypes  
✅ Continuous refinement  

### Disadvantages
❌ Complex to manage  
❌ Expensive  
❌ Requires risk assessment expertise  
❌ Not suitable for small projects  

### Best Use Cases
- Large, expensive, complex projects
- High-risk projects
- Projects with unclear requirements

## 6. Extreme Programming (XP)

### Description
Agile methodology emphasizing technical excellence and frequent releases in short development cycles.

### Advantages
✅ High code quality  
✅ Pair programming benefits  
✅ Test-driven development  
✅ Continuous integration  
✅ Simple design  

### Disadvantages
❌ Requires highly disciplined team  
❌ Can be exhausting  
❌ Less documentation  
❌ Requires customer availability  

### Best Use Cases
- Small to medium teams
- Projects with changing requirements
- Quality-critical applications
