# Task #1: System Development Steps, Process & Purpose

## System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. **Planning Phase**
**Purpose:** Define project scope, objectives, and feasibility
- Identify business needs and problems
- Conduct feasibility study (technical, economic, operational)
- Define project goals and constraints
- Estimate resources, time, and budget
- Create project charter

### 2. **Requirements Analysis**
**Purpose:** Gather and document system requirements
- Elicit requirements from stakeholders
- Analyze and prioritize requirements
- Document functional and non-functional requirements
- Create requirement specifications
- Validate requirements with stakeholders

### 3. **Design Phase**
**Purpose:** Create system architecture and detailed design
- Design system architecture
- Create database schema
- Design user interfaces
- Define system modules and components
- Create UML diagrams (use case, class, sequence, etc.)
- Design patterns and algorithms

**Citation:** Larman, C. (2004). *Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design* (3rd ed.). Prentice Hall.

---

### 4. **Implementation (Development)**
**Purpose:** Build the actual system
- Write source code following coding standards
- Implement database structures
- Develop user interfaces
- Integrate third-party components
- Version control and code review
- Documentation of code

**Citation:** Martin, R. C. (2008). *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship*. Prentice Hall.

---

### 5. **Testing Phase**
**Purpose:** Verify and validate system functionality
- Unit testing (individual components)
- Integration testing (modules working together)
- System testing (entire system)
- User acceptance testing (UAT)
- Performance and security testing
- Bug fixing and regression testing

**Citation:** Myers, G. J., Sandler, C., & Badgett, T. (2011). *The Art of Software Testing* (3rd ed.). John Wiley & Sons.

---

### 6. **Deployment**
**Purpose:** Release system to production environment
- Prepare deployment environment
- Data migration (if applicable)
- User training
- System installation
- Go-live activities
- Post-deployment monitoring

**Citation:** Humble, J., & Farley, D. (2010). *Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases*. Addison-Wesley Professional.

---

### 7. **Maintenance & Support**
**Purpose:** Ensure system continues to meet user needs
- Bug fixes and patches
- Performance optimization
- Feature enhancements
- System updates
- User support
- Documentation updates

**Citation:** IEEE Std 14764-2006. (2006). *IEEE Standard for Software Engineering—Software Life Cycle Processes—Maintenance*. IEEE Computer Society.

## SDLC Models

### Waterfall Model
- Sequential phases
- Each phase must complete before next begins
- Best for: Well-defined, stable requirements

### Agile Model
- Iterative and incremental
- Continuous feedback and adaptation
- Best for: Evolving requirements

### Spiral Model
- Risk-driven approach
- Combines iterative development with waterfall
- Best for: Large, complex, high-risk projects

**Citation:** Boehm, B. W. (1988). "A Spiral Model of Software Development and Enhancement." *Computer*, 21(5), 61-72.
